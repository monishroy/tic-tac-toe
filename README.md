Got it 👍
Here’s a **cross-platform `README.md`** that works for both **macOS** and **Windows** (also Linux).

A simple console-based Tic Tac Toe game written in C.  
It runs directly in the terminal and allows two players (X and O) to play turn by turn.

## 🚀 Features
- Two-player mode (X vs O).
- Numbered grid (1–9) for easy moves.
- Input validation (no overwriting moves).
- Declares **winner** or **draw**.
- Option to **play again** after finishing.

---

## ⚙️ Requirements
- C compiler:
  - **macOS / Linux:** [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) or GCC (pre-installed on most systems).
  - **Windows:** [MinGW](https://www.mingw-w64.org/) or [TDM-GCC](https://jmeubank.github.io/tdm-gcc/).

To check if you already have a compiler:
```bash
clang --version    # macOS / Linux
gcc --version      # Linux / Windows (MinGW)
````

## 🛠️ How to Compile & Run

### macOS / Linux

```bash
# Compile
clang tic_tac_toe.c -o tic_tac_toe_build

# OR with gcc
gcc tic_tac_toe.c -o tic_tac_toe_build

# Run
./tic_tac_toe_build
```

### Windows (MinGW)

1. Install [MinGW](https://www.mingw-w64.org/).
2. Open **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell**.
3. Navigate to the folder where `tic_tac_toe.c` is saved.
4. Run:

```bash
gcc tic_tac_toe.c -o tic_tac_toe_build.exe
```

5. Start the game:

```bash
tic_tac_toe_build.exe
```

## 🎲 Gameplay

* **X goes first**.
* Enter a number (1–9) to place your mark.
* Win by making 3 in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).
* If the board is full → Draw.

Would you like me to also include **setup instructions for VS Code** (with `tasks.json` so you can build/run with one click), or keep it strictly command-line for now?
